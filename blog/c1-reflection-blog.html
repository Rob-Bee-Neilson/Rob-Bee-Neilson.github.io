    <h2>Sprint 1 - Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>
    <h3>04/04/2018</h3>
    
    <p>
      I listened to Shereef's fire side chat yesterday while I had a migraine. I found it a positive and encouraging talk but was feeling so low and miserable all Shereef's encouraging words about how much you need to put into your study made me feel overwhelmed, I balked at the idea of beginning the bootcamp.

      I did enjoy the key points Shereef made. Taking control of my learning is something that really tickled my fancy and made me a little apprehensive; I like to do things my way and know how I like to learn yet at the same time I can feel there is plenty of conditioning toward the 'consumer package' approach in me.

      Certainly my bigger fear is that I don't know much about coding. Totes McGoats.

      I really appreciate the metality behind this bootcamp style of learning. Despite my fears and concerns I can see how so much of this reflects how I WANT to learn, I feel I need to jump into this just so I know for sure whats dreams/ideals and what works for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, I'm a little terified of what I'm going to do once I feel fully ok with taking charge of my self and learning, there is this sense of this vast chaotic/amazing/creative power waiting to be unleashed and I'm just now getting the sense of how I've been holding it back.
