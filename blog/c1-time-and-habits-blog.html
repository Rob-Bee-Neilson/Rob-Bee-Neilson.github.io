    <p>
        Which timebox and habits techniques did I try?
        I am familiar with meditation, mindfulness and flow concepts. Some of the other time management tools I have come across in similar form before. I have been attempting to bring a growth mindset into my days this week.
    </p>
    <p>
        What did I find interesting?
        The Pomodoro Technique appealed to me as a very accessable/useful tool and I found the Paid to Exist "Counterintuitive" advice very interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
        What worked for you?
        Meditation and mindfulness has been my friend for years. Some of the advice on Flow was useful in making that more accessable as a tool in my mind, particularly the differentiation from "Hyperfocus".
    </p>
    <p>
        Which will I experiment further with?
        I am keen to try the Pomodoro technique as a regular tool, and the Fogg method. Whether or not I maintain these as specific tools/concepts or adapt them as I see fit I do not know. :)
