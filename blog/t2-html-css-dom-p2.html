            <h2><span class="inverttext">What is grid based design?</span></h2>
            <p>Grid based design is essentially dividing up the webpage we are working on into a grid pattern, utilising rows and columns to place elements.<br>
                This has an immediate advantage in our design process as it relieves us from plotting elements with numerous, complicated xy coordinates. It also helps content stay aligned within a responsive webpage across browsers and devices.<br>
                There are numerous ways of implementing grid based design but a straight forward approach would be to define the width of our webpage, designate rows within the page breaking things down into broad boxes, then create (x) number of columns on the page to further break down the content and elements into boxes.<br>
                Pages are often divided into 12 columns as 12 can be divided by 2, 3, and 4. This can be represented by a fixed pixel count or as a percentage of the total page width, using 25%, 33.3%, 50% and 100% values.<br>
                This allows for a convienent number of combinations/iterations in our structure.<br>
                Each column corrosponds to a class that can be applied to HTML elements.

            <h2><span class="inverttext">Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</span></h2>
            <p>Responsive webpage can resize/realign to accomodate different browsers across different devices/resolutions, keeping a pleasant structure/presentation no matter how it is viewed.<br>
                This is important because over the last 5-10 years the increase in tablet+smart phone usage has increased dramatically, increasingly more people are using these devices than the more traditional desktops and laptops. With so many different ways of displaying your webpage having a responsive website is amazing.

            <h2><span class="inverttext">What is semantic structure?</span></h2>
            <p>In general, semantic structure can be called 'organization that represents meaning'. In language this is important, semantic rules make communication possible. They are rules that people have agreed on to give meaning to certain symbols and words. Misunderstandings happen when people give different meanings to the same words or phrases, or structure their sentences in different ways. Someone should have taught Yoda this sometime in his 900 odd years.<br>
                In programming languages and coding having correct semantic structure allows things to be computational, it makes it work. I'm sure everyone who has touched code must have come across some issue that arose from even the slightest incorrect symbol in the wrong place.
