                <h2>T5 Problem Solving</h2>
                <h3>Sprint 5<br>
                27/06/2018</h3><br>
                <p>
                    <em>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem:</em><br>
                    The easiest example I can think of for this was the final part of sprint-5.<br>
                    We had a fairly straight forward task of adding in code to make a very basic 'game' work. There was a grid of squares and we needed to make the squares change different colours when you clicked on them; squares could be blue, green or invisible.<br>
                    I managed to get this part working without much hassle.<br>
                    Once we had that part working we needed to get a counter going that would count how many blue, green, and invisible squares were on the board.<br>
                    This final part was relatively simple in concept but damned if I could get my thoughts straight on how to arrange my code to express this.<br>
                    I wrote the Pseudocode first then made attempt after attempt at translating it, I just couldn't think of the right commands to express what I was thinking.<br>
                    Then I went to the help material provided; I would read through it all, find something useful, think I could suddenly write it, then realise it wasn't right, and repeat.<br>
                    Eventually I thought I had the code to count the blue squares so I ran it, suddenly the squares in the 'game' would no longer change colour when clicked. Bugger.<br>
                    I wanted to check it was the new bit of code for the counter that was kooking things, so I removed it and ran the code again. Squares are changing colour.<br>
                    That confirmed my new code wasn't right and was upsetting the old code somehow. I looked and looked and couldn't think what was wrong.<br>
                    I started to wonder if I was calling my commands wrong, my mind was going around and around and confusing myself. I eventually convinced myself I had to put my commands into a function and tried that. Didn't work.<br>
                    I knew I had reached my limit so broke off and started trying to contact others, had a few suggestions, then came back to it the next day.<br>
                    I was still communicating with peers and was asked to push to GitHub so they could take a closer look at things. As I was doing so I decided to remove the function part, it just didn't feel right.<br>
                    As I was doing that I noticed a curley bracket that seemed out of place. I deleted it and ran the code, success!

                    <em>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you solved a problem in an elegant way:</em><br>
                    To be honest, I can't recall any examples. I know I have but can't remember the specifics.<br>
                    I know I have found a couple of good examples to use as templates through Google. MDN web docs has had a lot of useful pieces.<br>
                    Looking at other people's work around the internet and checking out how they solved things via the developer's tools has been helpful too.<br>
                    I was feeling tight on time when I was re-designing my web page so in the end I stripped it right back to basics and ended up finding I liked the clean, simple feel of it all. I have some room to go back and tidy up but I'm really happy with how it all works atm.<br>
                    Otherwise I've mostly been following the suggestions of the course as I've gone along.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In general; I've found taking time to step back and do other things resets the mind and is the most effective for overcoming a block.<br>
                    If it's a case of entering territory I just don't know or understand then talking to someone is tops. I'm trying not to but I really love knowing the answer first and working backward to see how it all works, things stick in my mind more if I do it this way but I know I can't always rely on there being an answer available.
