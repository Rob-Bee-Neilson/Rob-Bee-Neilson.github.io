                <h2>T4 Javascript Basics</h2>
                <h3>Sprint 4<br>

                <p>
                    <em>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</em><br>
                    If HTML and CSS are the structure and style of the website, Javascript is what enables interactive content. Drop down menus, forms, calculations, etc.<br>
                    Javascript is interesting because its executed 'client side', which means when we are visiting a page our browser will download the script and process it on our computer rather than the interwebs. This makes a lot of the processing much faster as  it doesn't rely on connection speed or quality.<br><br>
                    <em>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</em><br>
                    'Control flow' is the order that the computer executes a script's statements, its usually a logical/orderly pattern. You must read each bit of the code in order from start to finish, also you must look at how things are structured + how this may change things.<br>
                    Loops are code that quickly/easily do something repeatively. As far as I understand it atm, it's code that, when finished, will take you back to the start of its control flow and run through everything again (the same as before). It wil do this forever until a preset condition is met telling the loop to do otherwise.<br>
                    This makes me think of the famous Micky Mouse piece in Fantasia, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice", where the magic broom is given the loop task of filling the pool with buckets of water from the well but isn't told to stop when the pool is full - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DX2yVucz24"><em>entertainment ensures</em></a><br>
                    An Example:<br>
                    I have a set routine of what I do in the morning, its all very structured and orderly... Wake up, get out of bed, clothes on, walk dog, shower, breakfast... I do the same thing every morning. These steps would be the "control flow" of my morning's script.<br>
                    The fact that I do it every day the same we can think of as the loop, you execute it to completion (lets say all the way through to when I go to sleep), then the loop starts over.<br>
                    However, there may be conditions that will cause the loop to halt and something else to happen e.g. I go to walk the dog but the dog has escaped, now I have to look for the dog, I may not have time for my shower or breakfast before work.<br>
                    This new event that has been triggered may be a new loop, a single event, or...<br><br>
                    <em>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</em><br>
                    I'm not sure I have my head around this completely but I think if you want to access numerically indexed data you use arrays, and for non-numeric data you use objects.<br>
                    Just now I am reading that, in fact, everything in JavaScript is an object, arrays are objects that are just slightly modified.<br><br>
                    <em>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</em><br>
                    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Its sitting there all primed and waiting for the command to get into action. There can be other commands that call it into action. It's like a surprise party sitting waiting quietly for the right person to come walking in.
